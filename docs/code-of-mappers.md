# **Code of Mappers**
## For Responsible, Ethical, and Impactful Grid Mapping

This Code of Mappers outlines the shared values, responsibilities, and safe practices for individuals and organizations participating in grid mapping activities in OpenStreetMap. It is designed to safeguard communities, promote transparency, and protect sensitive areas while enabling open data for global development and energy resilience.

---

### 1. **Respect Conflict Zones and Local Laws**

* Do not map in regions of active conflict or military zones.
* Check local mapping regulations with the local [OSM community](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Power_networks#Local%20projects%20in%20Africa) before beginning any mapping.
* Mappers are expected to be aware of and comply with the laws and restrictions of the country they are operating in.

---

### 2. **Engage with Local Communities**

* Coordinate with local mappers and stakeholders before initiating mapping projects.
* Co-organize mapping events with local communities to ensure alignment with local needs and sensitivities.
* Seek community consent about which areas are considered sensitive and avoid entering them for any ground mapping activity.

---

### 3. **Map What Matters and Only What Matters**

* Map only features relevant to grid planning and modeling (e.g., line routes, towers, voltage levels, substation footprints).
* Do **not** map sensitive internal components such as control rooms, surveillance systems, or security details.
* Detailed mapping of busbars, detailed routing and circuits within substations should only be carried out in collaboration with local mappers and utility operators.

---

### 4. **Invite for Peer Review, Validation and Collaboration**

* Use validation tools and community moderation to review contributions.
* Flag and reverse problematic edits through OSMâ€™s version history.
* Strive for accuracy, clarity, and integrity in all contributions.
* Encourage academic and professional assessment of mapping data for resilience and security.


---

### 5. **Respect OpenStreetMaps License and Import Rules**


* Respect the [Verifiability rules of OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Verifiability) and only map objects that **you** can classify with the naked eye or using official satellite data.
* Do not directly copy any data into OpenStreetMap layers. You are allowed to use other datasets as a hint layer but never copy data/paste any data directly to OpenStreetMap data layers. If you want to import data, please refer to the offical [Import Guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines)

By adhering to this Code of Mappers, we collectively protect the integrity of the OSM platform, foster trust with communities, and unlock the power of open data for a more resilient and just energy future.
