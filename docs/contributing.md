# **Contribute and map with us!**

Our initiative wants to build a community of mappers from all around the world, so that power infrastructure is continuously added and improved in the future.
You can join this [discord](https://discord.gg/Z4Vxs8hZWU) server to learn more, and chat about OSM grid mapping with us.
