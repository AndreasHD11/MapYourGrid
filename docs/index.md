    <h2>Help Map the World's Electricity Grids to Power a Fossil-Free Future</h2>
    <p> Fossil fuels are responsible for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. You can play a vital role in supporting the energy transition by helping to map electrical grids in your local area. These grids need modernization to meet the demands of electrification and decarbonization, but a lack of reliable data is a <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/70f2de45-6d84-4e07-bfd0-93833e205c81/ElectricityGridsandSecureEnergyTransitions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major barrier</a>. Grid data provides governments, utilities, developers, and researchers with the information needed to plan effectively. That's where you come in.</p>
    <p>Despite the urgent need to expand and upgrade electricity infrastructure, there is currently no open global standard for cross-border grid data. OpenStreetMap has emerged as the unofficial, de facto standard used by both industry and academia. Some countries have good grid coverage, but many in the Global South are still lacking. This gap limits rural energy access and slows down climate action:</p>
    <blockquote>
      Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.
    </blockquote>

    <p>That is why <a href="https://openenergytransition.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Energy Transition</a> has launched this open initiative in collaboration with <a href="https://datactivist.coop/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Datactivist</a>, <a href="https://junglebus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jungle Bus</a>, <a href="https://dynartio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynartio</a> and <a href="https://www.infrageomatics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infrageomatics</a>. We are working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04550-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open digital twin of the European grid</a>, but also to expand the global coverage of the transmission grid in OpenStreetMap from around 70% to 98% by 2028. It's ambitious yet achievable with your help.</p>

  <p>OpenStreetMap's already extensive data on the electrical grid can be browsed on <a href="https://openinframap.org/#3.34/8.66/41.06/B,E,L,N,P" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Infrastructure Map</a>, showing the global scale of data collected since 2008, mostly by volunteers.</p> 
  <p>A global community of citizen contributors creates and maintains data on the core infrastructures of our modern society. Let's empower the mappers!</p>
