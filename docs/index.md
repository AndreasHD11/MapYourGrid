# Grid Mappers
<img src= images/logo_grid.png align="right" width="350">__**A directory and guide to power grid infrastructure mapping in OpenStreetMap.**__ <br> <br> We aim to contribute to mapping countries' electricity grid systems around the world. We strive to improving the power infrastructure data on OpenStreetMap, to enhance global energy system modelling.

## Grid Mapping
This directory includes information on the initiative, a starter-kit so that you can get started with grid-mapping, a list of tools developed to map more efficiently and accurately, and the awesome list! 

⚠️ **If you're eager to get started with transmission grid mapping in OpenStreetMap, check out the [Grid Mapping Starter Kit](https://github.com/open-energy-transition/grid-mapping-starter-kit) and [our community discord channel](https://discord.gg/6bPK5TXn).** ⚠️
