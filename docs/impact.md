1. The [Global Electrification Platform](https://electrifynow.energydata.info/) and [Distributed Renewable Energy Atlas](https://dre.energydata.info/), developed and used by the World Bank, support rural electrification planning across 58 countries. The [REZoning](https://rezoning.energydata.info/) project helps to identify and explore areas with high potential for solar, onshore and offshore wind development projects for 249 countries. Using OpenStreetMap data on transmission lines, substations, roads, buildings and settlements, they help to identify off-grid populations and inform the planning of renewables and both grid and off-grid strategies. gep-onsset, the Open Source Software behind Global Electrification Platform, [relies heavily on electrical grid data of OpenStreetMap](https://gep-onsset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GIS%20data%20collection.html#infrastructure).

1. The World Bank's [EnergyData.info](https://energydata.info/dataset/?q=OpenStreetMap) website hosts over 1,072 energy-related datasets, 533 of which directly depend on OpenStreetMap data. The World Bank uses this data to finance and support energy infrastructure projects in low- and middle-income countries, including expanding energy access, modernizing power systems, and promoting clean energy solutions. It also underpins major publications and creates reports for Decision Makers such as [Mini Grids for Half a Billion People](https://www.esmap.org/sites/default/files/esmap-files/Mini%20Grids%20for%20Half%20a%20Billion%20People%20-%20OKR%20Download%20Version_compressed_MKA.pdf).

1. The [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) provides high-quality, open geospatial data to guide decision-makers during early disaster response. With over 419,000 volunteer mappers, HOT collaborates with satellite imaging providers like Maxar and humanitarian agencies like the Red Cross to ensure emergency decisions are backed by reliable, verifiable data. Especially as the extreme weather events become more frequent, access to accurate electrical grid data [is increasingly critical for the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://github.com/USAFORUNHCRhive/turkana-grid-mapping).



## **<div class="tools-header">Why OSM Matters for the Electrical Grid?</div>**


OpenStreetMap’s electrical grid data is widely used by grid operators, academic institutions, government agencies, local authorities, and private organizations. It plays a crucial role in energy modeling and planning, shaping policy development and guiding investment decisions. 

These models help assess technological options, evaluate policy impacts, and map out pathways to full electrification, especially in developing countries. They're also critical for driving decarbonization and sustainable development. However, their accuracy depends heavily on the **quality and completeness of the data** they rely on.

### OSM for Smarter Energy Modelling 

One of the most prominent use cases of OSM grid data is in energy modeling tools. These tools help simulate how energy systems behave under different scenarios, from policy shifts to climate targets.

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 0 20px 20px; width: 500px; max-width: 100%">

Image Source: <a href="https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">Modelling the high-voltage grid using open data for
Europe and beyond</a></figcaption> 
</div> 


[PyPSA-Earth](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is the first energy model to enable regional studies based on OpenStreetMap to be carried out across the globe. The data is clustered into larger regional electrical hubs to simplify the power system model and improve computational efficiency. However, the energy potential of entire regions is underestimated if lines and substations are missing. Therefore, improving the current state of the OpenStreetMap's electrical grid data significantly enhances the reliability and effectiveness of this planning tool for energy studies in [regions all around the world](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users_list.html#). Initial attempts to use OpenStreetMap data for energy modeling are being made by the German Aerospace Center with the [SciGrid](https://www.dlr.de/en/ve/research-and-transfer/projects/project-scigrid) project starting in 2014. Afterwards, projects like [OSMoGrid](https://github.com/ie3-institute/OSMoGrid), [GridTool](https://github.com/IEE-TUGraz/GridTool), [osmTGmod](https://github.com/wupperinst/osmTGmod) and [OpenGridMap](https://github.com/opengridmap) have continued this development, first focusing on the German electrical grid.

###  Trusted by Leading International Organizations

Major international organizations rely on OpenStreetMap data for large-scale planning and decision-making.

The **World Bank** and **International Energy Agency (IEA)** use OSM in regional and continental energy studies—especially in areas where no other open infrastructure data exists.

Making this data freely available not only unlocks social value for planning but also economic value for private sector innovation.

**Recent policy recommendations:**

Energy infrastructure is central to solving today’s biggest challenges. Reliable and open infrastructure data directly supports the **adoption and success of clean energy projects** globally. These projects are being accelerated for several critical reasons:

* **Climate mitigation:** Fossil fuels account for roughly 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Resilience:** Clean energy strengthens resilience against climate impacts and extreme weather events.
* **Energy security:** Reducing reliance on imports enhances national energy independence, especially from politically unstable regions.

**In short:** the map matters. OpenStreetMap enables more informed decisions, faster clean energy deployment, and more inclusive planning, especially where the need is greatest.

--- 

### Growing Academic Recognition

To understand the influence of OpenStreetMap's electrical grid data in research, we analysed Google Scholar for publications combining `OpenStreetMap` with terms like `power grid`, `electrical grid`, `renewable` or `energy model`.

* 10,700 publications since 2005 included combinations of these keywords.
* A total of **2,460 publications** were released in the past year alone, demonstrating a rapid increase in academic interest and recognition of the power of OpenStreetMap data.


## **<div class="tools-header">Why Open Grid Data Matters?</div>**

Access to open and accurate data on electricity infrastructure is essential for effective planning, development, and collaboration, especially in the context of the global energy transition. The benefits are wide-reaching, from accelerating clean energy deployment to improving equity in energy access.

### Closing Data Gaps in Developing Countries

<div style="float: right; margin: 5px 0 20px 20px; width: 350px;">
  <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/africa-electricity-data-transparency/" target="_blank">

</div> 

In many low- and middle-income countries, data on electrical infrastructure is often **outdated, incomplete, or fragmented**, making it difficult for governments, utilities, and planners to take informed action. 

Even in high-income countries, while data may be more comprehensive, it is often **not publicly available** or limited by restrictive licensing. This hinders transparency and the ability to collaborate or validate results.


Open data helps overcome these barriers by ensuring that:

* Infrastructure planning is **more inclusive and cost-effective**.
* Datasets can be **cross-checked, reused, and improved** collaboratively.
* Policymakers and planners have **a reliable foundation** for decision-making.

--- 

### Building Trust Through Transparency and Traceability

Unlike proprietary platforms, OpenStreetMap's unique mapping methodology allows traceability and [verifiability](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Verifiability) of data sources: 

> "At the core, `verifiability` is that everything you do can be demonstrated to be true or false by other mappers."

Transparent planning, backed by open data, builds **public trust** and **institutional confidence**. Research shows that transparency increases public acceptance of infrastructure projects ([Ciupuliga & Cuppen, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421513003601)).

Thanks to its collaborative model, OpenStreetMap enables **local communities, NGOs, and governments** to contribute directly. This  leads to filling gaps, correcting errors, and improving the quality of infrastructure data. 

For example, the **YouthMappers** initiative in **Sierra Leone** mobilized local students and organizations to map the power grid, helping electricity providers reduce planning costs and improve infrastructure deployment ([Charles, 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05182-1_11)).

Open grid data is also instrumental in identifying **off-grid communities** allowing policymakers to target investment and expand access more effectively ([Arderne et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0347-4)).

### Saving Millions While Expanding Access

  <figcaption class="image-caption">Creating Foundation Electric Energy Infrastructure Data from Open-Sources document. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
</div> 

High-quality open data doesn't just improve access, it also reduces costs.

OpenStreetMap's data has enabled the government and local authorities to create high-quality datasets without having to pay for expensive proprietary ones. 

For example, the US Department of Energy and partners used open-source data to develop the "Electric Energy Infrastructure Data", resulting in **"estimated savings of 65% (~2 million dollars) over proprietary datasets"** ([Singh et al., 2023](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/poster-%20Creating%20Foundation%20Electric%20Energy%20Infrastructure%20Data%20from%20Open-Sources.pdf)). That’s a clear economic argument for open-source approaches.

### Examples from High-Income Countries
In most developed countries, publishing high-resolution, open datasets on the transmission grid has been common practice for more than a decade. For example:

* [**ENTSO-E**](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/map/) provides a pan-European **Transmission System Map** with georeferenced infrastructure data.
* RTE, the French grid operator, publishes its grid topology, including **5-minute resolution time-series data** on network operations ([RTE on GitHub](https://github.com/rte-france/structural-french-grid-data-with-detailed-topology-time-series)).
* Enedis, the French distribution system operator, committed to Open Data since 2015, is [joining forces with OpenStreetMap France](https://www.enedis.fr/presse/open-data-enedis-participe-un-projet-collaboratif-mondial-dechange-de-donnees) to make its grid data available and encourage crowdsourcing.

* The US Department of Homeland Security and other agencies publish national transmission grid data to support **emergency response, policy development, and economic planning**. These open datasets trace back to legislation from the 1990s that aimed to improve geospatial data sharing ([source](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/WCPD-1994-04-18/pdf/WCPD-1994-04-18-Pg779.pdf)). Within this dataset, OpenStreetMap is cited as the primary source for 24% of U.S. transmission lines.

* The US [Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://resilience.climate.gov/datasets/fedmaps::u-s-electric-power-transmission-lines/explore?location=38.846475%2C-76.984997%2C8.86) shows **strong alignment** with OpenStreetMap data, demonstrating how open contributions can match official datasets in coverage and accuracy.

## **<div class="tools-header">Responsible Grid Mapping: Understanding Risks and Mitigation</div>**

Mapping electricity transmission infrastructure is essential to reaching universal energy access, strengthening climate resilience, and enabling clean energy planning. But openness, especially in the realm of infrastructure, naturally raises questions about risk and security.

At MapYourGrid, we take these concerns seriously. This section explains : 

* What risks actually exist with open grid data, 
* Why the benefits of responsible mapping far outweigh them, 
* How we mitigate potential harms through careful, community-informed practices. 

For the past 17 years, transmission grid data has been created on a global scale in OpenStreetMap without any major legal issues being identified. Today, MapYourGrid is closing the gap for low-to-middle income countries, helping them to increase their coverage from around 70% to 98%.

---

### Why Infrastructure Mapping Raises Concerns

Electric transmission infrastructure is widely regarded as critical to national and regional stability. It powers economies, supports healthcare systems, and connects communities. 

So it's reasonable to ask: 
**Does publishing the location of power lines and substations expose a system to new threats?**

This is a valid concern. While OSM mapping focuses only on non-sensitive, publicly visible features, it’s important to understand where the line is drawn.

---

### Most Grid Infrastructure is Already Publicly Visible

In reality, the vast majority of grid infrastructure is already accessible through:

- Satellite imagery platforms like Google Earth and Bing Maps.
- National and regional planning documents.
- Government datasets, such as the U.S. HIFLD database or the EU's ENTSO-E platform.
- Commercial mapping services, which label substations and transmission corridors.

OpenStreetMap does not introduce new visibility, but rather transforms existing imagery into usable, traceable, openly licensed data. This ensures high quality data through traceability and verifiability. OpenStreetMap provides structured, standardised, openly licensed data that is accessible to communities, researchers, planners and public institutions.

### The Greater Risk: Lack of Data

For much of the world, the absence of reliable, accessible grid data creates more harm than openness ever could. In countries with expanding populations, growing urban centers, or rural electrification needs, decisions about where to invest in infrastructure depend on having accurate spatial data.

**Without it:**

- Electrification efforts stall due to uncertainty in grid reach and capacity.
- Renewable energy developers face delays or suboptimal siting.
- Emergency response teams cannot plan around real-world grid layouts.
- Public agencies lack the tools to ensure transparency and resilience.

Mapping transmission infrastructure in OpenStreetMap helps close this data gap.

### Our Approach to Risk Mitigation

MapYourGrid implements a layered, context-aware framework to ensure that mapping serves the public good while respecting national sensitivities and community priorities. Read more about this in our [Code of Mappers](./code-of-mappers.md).

#### Community Consent and Local Alignment

We motivate mappers to engage directly with regional OpenStreetMap communities. We provide training, host collaborative events, and support in-country mapping leaders to ensure that each initiative reflects local knowledge, laws and priorities.

#### Clear Boundaries on What We Map

**We focus strictly on features that are:**

- Publicly observable in satellite imagery.
- Relevant to energy planning.
- Safe and appropriate for open mapping.

**We map:**

- Power line routes.
- Power tower locations. 
- Power substation boundaries.
- Voltage classifications. 

**We do *NOT* map:** 

- Substation interiors or fencing.
- Control systems or communications infrastructure.
- Security or surveillance features.

This ensures that OSM grid data is useful without compromising operational or physical security. Detailed mapping of busbars, detailed routing and circuits within substations should only be carried out in collaboration with local mappers and utility operators.

#### Data Validation and Version Control

Every contribution to OpenStreetMap is timestamped, attributed, and fully reversible. 

The OSM platform includes built-in tools to detect suspicious edits, and MapYourGrid-supported projects include an additional layer of human quality control, expert review, and automated validation tools.

This model promotes transparency and reduces the risk of error or malicious contributions going unnoticed.

### What the Evidence Shows

Research and operational experience from agencies like the U.S. Department of Energy and the International Energy Agency shows that :

- Most disruptions to power grids are caused by extreme weather, aging infrastructure, or coordination failures. 
- Physical and cyber attacks are typically unrelated to the kind of public infrastructure data found in OpenStreetMap.
- A lack of data often worsens the consequences of these risks by delaying coordination and limiting visibility during emergencies.

### Comparative Overview

| Dataset                     | Access            | Source                             | Security Level   | Grid Coverage           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| OpenStreetMap (OSM)         | Public             | Community + public imagery          | Moderate          | Transmission + Distribution |
| HIFLD (US DHS)              | Public/Restricted  | Government + OSM-derived            | Controlled         | Transmission only       |
| CEII (FERC, U.S.)           | Restricted         | Grid operators                      | High               | Transmission only       |

OpenStreetMap data is often used to validate or supplement these official datasets, not replace them.

### Supporting Responsible Openness

For donors, researchers, and institutions that want to support open infrastructure data while mitigating risk, we recommend the following:

**Do:**

- Emphasize climate resilience, public benefit, and equity.
- Highlight real-world examples where open data improved planning or disaster response.
- Work closely with regional stakeholders and community mappers.
- Fund training, peer review, and documentation improvements.

**Avoid:**

- Supporting mapping in high-conflict areas.
- Treating openness as an all-or-nothing issue.
- Understating the need for careful stewardship and legal awareness.

### Final Thoughts

Transmission grid mapping in OpenStreetMap is already contributing to real-world progress: From modeling electrification pathways in sub-Saharan Africa to enabling renewable energy siting in Southeast Asia.

By balancing transparency with care, and openness with accountability, we believe it's possible to expand access to infrastructure data while minimizing risk. The global clean energy transition depends on this kind of open, responsible collaboration.
