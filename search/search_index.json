You can play a vital role in supporting the energy transition by helping to map electrical grids in your local area. These grids need modernization and expansion to meet the demands of electrification and decarbonization, but a lack of reliable data is a major barrier. Grid data provides governments, utilities, developers, and researchers with the information needed to plan effectively. That's where you come in.</p> <p>In recent years, OpenStreetMap has emerged as the de facto standard for global electrical grid data. However, many developing countries are still lagging behind. This gap limits rural energy access and slows down climate action:</p>        Improve data reliability and availability to better assess and manage risks for clean energy projects in emerging market and developing economies.      <p>       Key Recommendation - International Energy Agency: How to implement the COP28 energy goals </p> Towards a Globally Mapped Grid <p>       We are working with the OpenStreetMap community, organisations and individuals around the world to not only create an        open digital twin of the European grid, but also to expand global transmission grid coverage in OSM from 70% to 98% by 2028. MapYourGrid enables this through training, multiple validation strategies, optimized open-source tools and community building.</p> <p>OpenStreetMap's already extensive data on the electrical grid can be browsed on Open Infrastructure Map, showing the global scale of data collected since 2008, mostly by volunteers.</p> <p>A global community of citizen contributors creates and maintains data on the core infrastructures of our modern society.

In some countries, the mapping of transmission lines is not permitted. Get in touch with local users by finding out about local projects.  If you can't find a local community, please send us an email and we will help you set up a local group.</p> <p>By following our Code of Mappers, we collectively protect the integrity of the OpenStreetMap platform, foster trust with communities, and unlock the power of open data for a more resilient and just energy future. Please do NOT copy any data from hint layer directly into your OpenStreetMap data layer. Every data point in your OpenStreetMap data layer must be manually set and verified. The metadata must also be verified against compatible licensed sources or by people on the ground. If you cannot verify the data using satellite images or any other compatible source, please do not add this information from hint layers. This may seem like a high burden at first, but it ensures the high quality of OpenStreetMap. </p> <p>Risk of Double Mapping</p> <p>Please bear in mind that you have only downloaded transmission grid data for the country, state or province that you selected. This includes power plants, generators, substations, power towers and transmission lines. Other OpenStreetMap objects, such as streets, will not be visible. Therefore, never use our tools to map objects other than those loaded via Overpass, as otherwise other mappers will have to clean up the duplicate data.</p> <p>Some cross-border transmission lines will still be visible beyond the pink administrative boundaries. However, to edit these, you will need to load both countries. Never map beyond the pink administrative boundaries, as this will most likely result in infrastructure being mapped twice.</p>"},{"location":"map-it/#join-the-chat","title":"Join the Chat","text":"<p>We welcome everyone to join our \ud83d\udccd-MapYourGrid discord channel.

We map transmission lines that link cities. The transmission grid infrastructure is so large that it can be traced and mapped using open satellite images. However, the distribution grid cannot be mapped sufficiently well using open satellite images alone and therefore requires strong collaboration with local communities and authorities. For this reason, this is not currently our main focus.</p>"},{"location":"questions/#wont-all-of-this-be-solved-by-ai-soon","title":"Won't all of this be solved by AI soon?","text":"<p>To ensure data quality, each data point in OpenStreetMap must be set and validated by a human. This prevents OpenStreetMap from becoming flooded with synthetic, unvalidated data that would not be suitable as ground truth in the long term. Furthermore, there are currently no detection methods that can accurately identify power towers and the course of transmission lines using classic RGB satellites alone. Grid mapping is a task that requires a high degree of expertise and contextual understanding. Due to the high relevance of this data, stochastic generation of the grid by AI is also not recommended. To validate this data, specialists must perform active grid mapping. However, we are currently evaluating the use of open-source substation detection based on Sentinel 2 data to provide another hint layer of substations for the mappers. </p>"},{"location":"questions/#does-publishing-this-data-create-a-security-risk","title":"Does Publishing this Data Create a Security Risk?","text":"<p>No, publishing grid data through MapYourGrid does not meaningfully increase security risks. This concern is understandable because electrical grids are critical infrastructure. However, multiple studies and real-world practices show that open grid data does not elevate threat levels, for several key reasons:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Much of the grid is already visible and documented. Transmission lines are easily observable in satellite imagery and by anyone on the ground. Most substations are already in platforms like Google Maps. Major institutions, including government agencies, have publicly shared detailed grid data for decades.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sophisticated actors already have better data. State-sponsored or malicious actors do not rely on OpenStreetMap. They have access to more advanced tools, commercial imagery, or even insider or cyber channels. Blocking public access doesn\u2019t prevent their activity, but it hinders legitimate use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open data helps defenders more than attackers.

Priority should therefore be given to large, high-voltage infrastructure first. </p> <p>Please consider the following strategies and the associated processes as recommendations only. Ultimately, the most efficient strategy is the one that enables you to work on the electrical grid with passion and motivation over a longer period of time. The strategies can be divided into two phases, with a quality assurance and validation process running alongside them.</p> <p>Pioneer Mapping Strategies: To ensure the power grid has the best possible coverage, we recommend beginning with Pioneer Mapping in each country. Several strategies are employed at this stage to identify the location of all lines, power poles, and substations. Rather than reducing issues in the grid, the main focus is on increasing extending geographic coverage of the grid. This may result in an increased total number of issues in the grid. These strategies focus primarily on mapping the geographical location of power lines, towers, plants and substations, rather than technical grid details. They require good eyesight, fast mapping skills and an understanding of situations in which satellite data is insufficient for consistent grid mapping.</p> <p>Technical Mapping Strategies: This phase involves solving complex grid issues that require a fundamental understanding of the electrical grid. This includes mapping voltages, the number of circuits and routing issues. During this phase, the initial mapping work is validated against multiple sources to ensure its plausibility. These sources could include official maps from grid operators, statistics about grid length, and other official data. The main focus of these strategies is to minimise the number of complex quality issues in the grid.</p> <p>Quality Assurance and Validation: Quality assurance runs parallel to both mapping phases and ensures that all data is verifiable, follows agreed tagging standards, is traceable, and can be reviewed by others. Tools like JOSM, Osmose, ohsome stats, and Open Infrastructure Map, along with community feedback and AI-assisted checks, help maintain the accuracy and reliability of the electrical grid data on OpenStreetMap.</p>"},{"location":"tools/#pioneer-mapping-strategies-and-tools","title":"Pioneer Mapping Strategies and Tools","text":"Todo Plugin Map Fast Coordinates and JOSM Continue Open Lines Spot the Gaps in the Grid Connect Power Plants Connect Substations  Connect Industrial Areas  Connect WikiData"},{"location":"tools/#todo-plugin","title":"Todo Plugin","text":"<p>The Todo plugin is used for almost all pioneer mapping strategies, systematically stepping through a dataset of <code>hints</code>.</p>  A simple but very efficient way of mapping the network is the continuation of \u201cUnfinished Transmission Lines loaded into the Todo plugin\u201d.

MapYourGrid builds on this community foundation to ensure the highest quality standards for mapping global electrical infrastructure.</p> <p>MapYourGrid's validation approach is based on the verifiability principles of OpenStreetMap:</p> <p>\"At the core, \"verifiability\" is that everything you do can be demonstrated to be true or false by other mappers.\"</p> <p>This principle applies to every aspect of mapping: the physical presence of infrastructure, the accuracy of geometries, and the clarity of tags and values. A tag and geometry are considered verifiable only if another mapper, with the same inputs, would record them identically. This objective, evidence-based method is what makes OpenStreetMap a trusted source for academic research, governmental planning, and industrial analysis.</p> <p>MapYourGrid layers additional tools, methodologies, and community-driven feedback mechanisms on top of this foundation to ensure data accuracy, completeness, and reliability. Here's how we do it:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Professional Training, Standards and Support in Electrical Grid Mapping</p> <p>The MapYourGrid initiative recognizes that high-quality data begins with knowledgeable contributors. We invest in building mapper capacity through structured training, professional-grade documentation, and standards aligned with both OpenStreetMap norms and the energy sector\u2019s expectations. We support decentralized data stewardship by empowering local mappers to guide regional efforts, ensuring that data remains both accurate and contextually relevant over time.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Feedback and Crowdsourced Issue Reporting</p> <p>We encourage anyone using Open Infrastructure Map to report issues using the #MapYourGrid hashtag. Notes can be added without an account, lowering the barrier to participation. These community-sourced observations help identify outdated, misclassified, or missing infrastructure. This makes user feedback a cornerstone of validation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pre-Upload Error Detection with JOSM Validator</p> <p>Before data is uploaded to OpenStreetMap, it is automatically scanned using the JOSM Validator. This tool checks for common mapping errors such as: Illogical tag combinations, unusual geometries (e.g., excessively long spans between power towers) or incomplete or deprecated data.</p> <p>Warnings are prominently flagged, and mappers are discouraged from uploading until the issues are resolved, promoting a high standard of data hygiene.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visual Quality Checks with Custom Map Styles</p> <p>Custom map painting styles specific to power infrastructure make it easier to spot errors visually within JOSM. These styles highlight anomalies, such as disconnected segments or misclassified equipment, empowering mappers to perform visual audits in real time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Human-in-the-Loop Review Option</p> <p>By enabling the \u201cI would like someone to review my edits\u201d option in JOSM, contributors can request peer validation. The #mapyourgrid hashtag allows us to track these submissions and offer direct support, especially for:</p> <ul> <li>New contributors working through tutorials</li> <li>Edits based on unclear or low-resolution satellite imagery</li> </ul> <p>These reviews can involve experienced mappers or electrical grid specialists, providing both technical accuracy and mentorship.</p> </li> <li> <p>Daily Automated Quality Assurance via Osmose</p> <p>The Osmose QA platform runs automated checks daily on the global grid data, focusing on:</p> <ul> <li>Inconsistent voltage tagging</li> <li>Isolated or unconnected transmission lines</li> <li>Redundant or deprecated tagging</li> </ul> <p>Osmose QA has items and classes, these can be thought of as categories with items listed inside each category. Being a global tool, Osmose does quality checks on many layers of the OSM data beyond the power infrastructures. It is important to know what items and issues are of value for transmission grid mapping. This list of relevant issues is what is made available on the Map It\ud83d\udccd page:</p> Item Class Description Summary 7040 1 Lone Power Towers or Poles This tower should surely be connected to a power line 2 Unfinished Power Transmission line The line ends in a vacuum, and should be connected to another line or a transformer (<code>power=</code>) or a generator (<code>power=</code>). 3 Connection between different Voltages Two lines meet at one point, but have inconsistent voltages (<code>voltage=*</code>) 4 None Power node on Power Way If this node is a tower or pole, tag with <code>power=</code>; else remove it. 5 Missing Power Tower or Pole Based on pole spacing, one appears to be missing on this line. 6 Unfinished Power Distribution line The distribution line ends in a vacuum, and should connect to another distribution line or power structure. 7 Unmatched Voltage of line on Substation Ensure the voltage of lines matches the substation's rated voltage. <p>These issues are visualized directly in Open Infrastructure Map, giving mappers clear targets for improving the dataset.    Special care is taken to validate and investigate interconnectors between different countries like the  Kenya-Tanzania interconnector.   </p> </li> <li> <p>Statistical Monitoring with Health Scores (Under Construction)</p> <p>Tools like ohsome stats provide macro-level insights into mapping activity. They help detect:</p> <ul> <li>Under-mapped regions or infrastructure gaps by comparing national line length statistics with OpenStreetMap</li> <li>Unusual tagging patterns or mapping anomalies</li> <li>Inactive areas with aging or outdated grid data</li> </ul> <p>Hashtag based tracking also enables performance monitoring and campaign evaluation across time and geography. All this statistical data, along with the osmose issues, is used to calculate a health score for the electrical grid. </p> </li> <li> <p>Integration and Interoperability Tests (Under Construction)</p> <p>We routinely test how well OSM electrical data integrates with external systems and applications. This ensures that the data model is not only internally consistent but also compatible with real-world use cases, including load flow analysis, planning tools, and emergency response platforms. We test the dataset against other open and proprietary energy system models and frameworks to verify structural and semantic compatibility. Interoperability ensures that OSM-based grid data can be adopted widely, fostering trust among academic and industrial users.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sensitivity Analysis (Under Construction)</p> <p>By simulating changes in voltage, topology, or component tagging, we measure how sensitive derived outputs (e.g., load estimations or reliability models) are to input variations. This helps identify critical data points where higher accuracy or verification is essential.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expert and Peer Cross-Validation (Under Construction)</p> <p>Experienced technical mappers and energy system experts regularly review the data, particularly in complex regions with overlapping voltages, substations, or unusual infrastructure types. In combination with qualitative comparisons with third-party studies, statistics or official electrical grid maps, these experts gather all insights about data quality. They are capable of comaring different validation results to approve, release and version control electrical grid data. They can compare different validation results in order to approve, release and control the version of electrical grid data. This allows them to update the community on any significant grid data issues that have been identified.</p> </li> <li> <p>AI-Assisted Random Sample and Field Validation (Under Construction)</p> <p>We leverage AI to detect unmapped infrastructure from satellite imagery and flag anomalies in existing data. Random samples are then validated on the ground through local partners, combining remote detection with field-level truthing.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Together, these layers of validation, spanning crowdsourcing, automation, expert review, and AI, make MapYourGrid not just a mapping initiative, but a quality-assured knowledge infrastructure for the global energy transition.</p>"},{"location":"blog/firstrename/","title":"Firstrename","text":"Liberate the Grid <p>Andreas Hernandez Denyer  \u00b7  April 25, 2025 </p> <p>Welcome to our Blog.
